// # [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

// #### Challenge 1: Flavor Selection
// Given a variable that holds a user's preferred type of Monster Energy drink, 
// print whether the user prefers a "Regular" or "Sugar-free" variety. If the preference is not set, default to "Regular".

let userPreference = 'Sugar-free'; // Possible values: 'Regular', 'Sugar-free', or undefined

if(userPreference == 'Sugar-free') {
    console.log("Sugar-Free Monster Energy Drink!");
} else if(userPreference == 'Regular') {
    console.log("Regular Monster Energy Drink!");
} else {
    console.log('Undefined!');
}


// #### Challenge 2: Stock Check
// You have a variable that tracks the number of Monster Energy cans left in the fridge. 
// Use a ternary operator to print "Time to restock!" if the number is less than 5, or "We're stocked!" if the number is 5 or more.

let cansLeft = 3; // Any number of cans
if(cansLeft < 5) {
    console.log("Time to restock!");
} else {
    console.log("We're stocked!");
}


// #### Challenge 3: Workout Intensity
// Based on the current heart rate, determine if the user should drink a Monster Energy drink to boost their workout. 
// If the heart rate is below 100 bpm, print "Boost needed!", otherwise, print "Energy levels are high!".

let heartRate = 95; // Current heart rate in bpm
if(heartRate < 100) {
    console.log("Boost needed!");
} else {
    console.log("Energy Levels are high!");
}


// #### Challenge 4: Temperature Suitability
// Monster Energy drinks are best served cold. Given the current temperature, use a ternary to print "Chilled to perfection!" 
// if the temperature is below or equal to 5°C, or "Needs a cooler!" if above 5°C.

let currentTemp = 4; // Current temperature in °C
if(currentTemp < 5) {
    console.log("Chilled to perfection!")
} else {
    console.log("Needs a cooler!")
}


// #### Challenge 5: Late Night Coding Session
// Determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour.
// If it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!",
// otherwise, print "Better stick to water."

// Define the current hour in 24-hour format
let currentHour = 22; 

// Write your code below this line to determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour
// If it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!"
// Otherwise, print "Better stick to water."
if( 7 < currentHour < 24) {
    console.log("Unleash the beast!");
} else {
    console.log("Better stick to water");
}






// In each of these challenges, the ternary operator is used to decide between two options based on a condition, 
// demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic. Remember that while ternaries can make the code more succinct, 
// they should be used judiciously to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions.
